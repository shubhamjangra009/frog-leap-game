# FROG LEAP GAME
The objective of the puzzle is to switch the positions of all the colored frogs, so that all three brown frogs are on the right and all three green frogs are on the left. When all the frogs have reached the other side of the pond, you win!

Choose a frog to make it jump forward or backward. A frog can jump a maximum of two spaces, and the destination spot must be free.

Brwon frogs can only hop to the right. Green frogs can only hop to the left. Frogs can only jump onto an empty rock. A frog can jump over one frog to an empty rock—but only over one.

Frogs cannot jump back, only forward. It’s easy to tell which way they can go—they face the way they want to jump.

If you get stuck and your frogs can't jump anywhere, restart the code to reset the game.
